Continue to lift them until they are at shoulder level. Pause for a second at the top of the movement, then slowly lower the weights back down to the starting position. Repeat this movement for the desired number of repetitions. Remember to keep your spine neutral and your movements controlled throughout the exercise, avoiding any swinging or jerking."
